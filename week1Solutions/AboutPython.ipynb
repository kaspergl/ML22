We will be using Python 3 here, which is not compatible with Python 2.x. For an introduction to Python the [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3.5/tutorial/index.html) is a great place to start; Similarly for [Getting Started](http://scipy.org/getting-started.html) with the Numpy and Matplotlib good places to start are the Numpy [Quickstart tutorial](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/quickstart.html) and the [pyplot tutorial](http://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.html). If you have earlier experience with MATLAB, then the [Numpy for Matlab users](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html) document is a useful reference.\n",
