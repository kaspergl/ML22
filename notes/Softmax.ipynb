    "# Softmax  Regression - Logistic Regression for many classes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we generalize logistic regression to handle $K$\n",
    "classes instead of 2. This is often known as Multinomial Regression or Softmax, but sometimes Logistic Regression refers to this more general case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**We will use the exact same approach as for Logistic Regression**, but it becomes slightly more technical due to the extra\n",
    "classes.\n",

    "## The Setup\n",
    "Assume the problem at hand is a multiclass classification problem with $K$ classes.\n",
    "For this problem we choose to encode the target labels in a very particular way.\n",
    "\n",
    "A target value $y$ is naturally represented as a number in $\\{1, \\dots, K\\}$. However, for this exposition we chose to represent it as a vector of\n",
    "length $K$ with all zeros except one which corresponds to the class. This is called a *one-in-K encoding*.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a data point $x$ is labelled with class 3 and there are five classes then\n",
    "$y = [0,0,1,0,0]^\\intercal = e_3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To store the labels of all data points we create a matrix $Y$ of size $n \\times K$.\n",
    "The data matrix $X$ is unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X=\\begin{pmatrix} \n",
    "1&- & x_1^T & - \\\\\n",
    "\\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\n",
    "1&- & x_n^T & - \\\\\n",

    "- & y_n^T & -\\end{pmatrix}\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n\\times K}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To generalize to $K$ classes we will use $K$ weight vectors $w_1,\\dots,w_k$ each of length $d$, one for each class.\n",
    "If we wanted to do classification, we could do as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given data x, compute $w_i^\\intercal x$ for $i=1,\\dots, K$ and return the index of the largest value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, this list of weight vectors we pack into a matrix $W$ of size $d \\times K$ by putting $w_1$ in column one and so on.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This way we can compute the weighed sum for each class by the vector matrix product $x^\\intercal W$ and then pick argmax of that to do the classification. Pretty Neat!.\n"
